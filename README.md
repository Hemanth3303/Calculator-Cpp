# Calculator-Cpp
A scuffed calculator app made in c++ using [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for learning purposes.

## Notes
Build system is premake<br>
Tested only on windows with Visual Studio 2022<br>
Only uses mouse for input<br>
Calculations are not fully tested to be mathematically accurate, possible violations of order of expressions rules<br>

# Warning
This was made so that I could force myself to code something after not having coded anything in over 3 months. This was made in about four hours so the code is really bad, I won't recommend reading through it. There is probably a better way to do every single thing I have written in this. <br>

<b>DO NOT USE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO WRITE GOOD C++</b>
